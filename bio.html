                <p><strong>Gita Gopinath</strong> is the Gregory and Ania Coffey Professor of Economics at Harvard University. Her research focuses on International Finance and Macroeconomics where she is a leading voice on dollar dominance, exchange rates, trade and investment, international financial crises, monetary policy and debt. Previously, she was the First Deputy Managing Director (FDMD) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from January 2022–August 2025 and prior to that she was the Chief Economist of the IMF from January 2019-January 2022. In her role as FDMD, the #2 official of the IMF, she oversaw the work of senior staff, represented the Fund at multilateral fora such as G7 and G20, maintained high-level contacts with member governments and Board members, the media, and other institutions, led the Fund's work on surveillance and oversaw large IMF programs, such as those for Argentina and Ukraine.</p>

                <p>As Chief Economist, she helmed thirteen releases of the World Economic Outlook, including forecasts of the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the global economy. She co-authored the "<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/Staff-Discussion-Notes/Issues/2021/05/19/A-Proposal-to-End-the-COVID-19-Pandemic-460263" target="_blank">Pandemic Proposal</a>" on how to end the COVID-19 pandemic that set globally endorsed targets for vaccinating the world and led to the creation of the Multilateral Task Force made up of the leadership of the IMF, World Bank, WTO, and WHO to help end the pandemic and the establishment of a working group with vaccine manufacturers to identify trade barriers, supply bottlenecks, and accelerate delivery of vaccines to low- and lower-middle income countries. She spearheaded the Fund's work on the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/IPF-Integrated-Policy-Framework" target="_blank">Integrated Policy Framework</a>, which provides a robust analytical framework to help countries determine the appropriate policies for macroeconomic and financial stability.</p>

                <p>Dr. Gopinath is a member of President Emmanuel Macron's G7 Economists Group on global imbalances, a member of the European Investment Bank's Global Advisory Council and of the Chicago Federal Reserve's Financial Stability Advisory Council.

She has previously served as the co-director of the International Finance and Macroeconomics program at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), a member of the economic advisory panel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. She is the co-editor of the current Handbook of International Economics and was earlier the co-editor of the American Economic Review and managing editor of the Review of Economic Studies.</p>

                <p>Dr. Gopinath is the recipient of the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, the highest honor conferred on overseas Indians by the Government of India, and the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the University of Washington.
